A portfolio built with React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind. Showcases three projects with reusable cards and article pages. This site focuses on clean UI, accessible patterns, and a simple content pipeline (project data in one place, UI reuses typed components).

This is my personal portfolio site, showcasing selected coursework and projects. It isn’t intended as a multi-contributor project, but you’re welcome to explore the code and structure. 

## Key Features 🌟
